# Invisible Cloak

Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisible cloak. Well it turns out that 
using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy. 
This [code](AR_invisibility_Cloak.py) turns a `red` colour thing into an invisible thing , but you should use a cloth for real fun.
